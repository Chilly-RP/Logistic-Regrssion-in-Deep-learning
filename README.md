# Logistic-Regrssion-in-Deep-learning

**Instructions:**
- Use 'np.dot(X,Y)' to calculate dot prodcuts

**Learning Objectives:**
- Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
    - Initializing parameters
    - Calculating the cost function and its gradient
    - Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
- Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
